/* Try to think of number, e.g.19, as a position.
   So with every pass the position changes.

    From 19 â†’10 â†’ 7â€¦..
    
    and it is calculated by,
    subtracting, deleted positions before 19 with every pass.
    
     
    i.e. Pass 1, where 2nd item is deleted.
    19 - (19/2) = 10 (new position)
